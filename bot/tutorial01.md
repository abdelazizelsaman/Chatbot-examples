# Create your 1st Chatbot (No Coding required)

In this tutorial, I will walk through the first steps to develop your 1st chatbot. In this tutorial we will use IBM Watson 
Conversation Service. IBM have launched a free online educational program "Digital Nation Africa" for African nations to learn more about brand new cutting-edge technologies like AI & Cloud Computing. Also you will get a badge after completing any course. I recommend starting with DN-A if you want to start learning new technologies like AI, Blockchain or cloud computing. 

Here are our steps to create our 1st chatbot:

1- Create an account on [DN-A](https://developer.ibm.com/africa/).

2- Finish ["Getting Started with IBM Cloud"](https://developer.ibm.com/africa/skills/innovator-getting-started-with-ibm-cloud/) Course.

3- Finish ["Build your own chatbot"](https://developer.ibm.com/africa/skills/innovator-chatbot-for-good/) Course.

If you can't access DN-A or you need more info about chatbots in general, you can review my [Prezi](https://prezi.com/view/qVzJdIZuseHtBDFPWVSx/) presentation which covers the chatbot topic more deeply. Also you can start the IBM Chatbot course on Coursera or edx.

4- After confirming your account, you will receive  a bunch of e-mails including an IBM Cloud account activation e-mail. 
Since that all your work will be on cloud, IBM will create a lite IBM account for you.
